Bad time for him to be writing and promoting a book especially since he has done such a poor job with Covid and Crime. So many unnecessary deaths. The City &amp; State have sunk to historic lows...,2020,Republican
DonaldTrump,....Washington wants nothing to do with him and that’s so bad for New York which has become a ghost town. Andrew spends too much time listening to his brother Fredo. Forget the books and your apology tour. The Federal Government would love to help New York regain its luster!,2020,Republican
DonaldTrump,...P.S. Tony should stop wearing the Washington Nationals’ Mask for two reasons. Number one it is not up to the high standards that he should be exposing. Number two it keeps reminding me that Tony threw out perhaps the worst first pitch in the history of Baseball!,2020,Republican
DonaldTrump,Dr.Tony Fauci says we don’t allow him to do television and yet I saw him last night on @60Minutes and he seems to get more airtime than anybody since the late great Bob Hope. All I ask of Tony is that he make better decisions. He said “no masks &amp; let China in”. Also Bad arm!,2020,Republican
DonaldTrump,GREAT news! New government of Sudan which is making great progress agreed to pay $335 MILLION to U.S. terror victims and families.

DonaldTrump,Joe Biden is a corrupt politician and everybody knows it. Now you have the proof perhaps like never was had before on a major politician. Laptop plus. This is the second biggest political scandal in our history!,2020,Republican
DonaldTrump,Hunter Biden’s laptop is a disaster for the entire Biden family but especially for his father Joe. It is now a proven fact and cannot be denied that all of that info is the REAL DEAL. That makes it impossible for “50% or 10%” Joe to ever assume the office of the President!,2020,Republican
DonaldTrump,The United States shows more CASES than other countries which the Lamestream Fake News Media pounces on daily because it TESTS at such a high (and costly) level.

DonaldTrump,....practically nothing. Both Senators became totally unelectable couldn’t come even close to winning their primaries and decided to drop out of politics and gracefully “RETIRE”. @SenSasse could be next or perhaps the Republicans should find a new and more viable candidate?,2020,Republican
DonaldTrump,Senator Little Ben Sasse of the Great State of Nebraska seems to be heading down the same inglorious path as former Senators Liddle’ Bob Corker whose approval rating in Tennessee went from 55% to 4% &amp; Jeff “the Flake” Flake whose approval rating in Arizona went from 56% to....,2020,Republican
DonaldTrump,The least effective of our 53 Republican Senators and a person who truly doesn’t have what it takes to be great is Little Ben Sasse of Nebraska a State which I have gladly done so much to help. @SenSasse was as nice as a RINO can be until he recently won the Republican....,2020,Republican
DonaldTrump,...Nomination to run for a second term. Then he went back to his rather stupid and obnoxious ways. Must feel he can’t lose to a Dem. Little Ben is a liability to the Republican Party and an embarrassment to the Great State of Nebraska. Other than that he’s just a wonderful guy!,2020,Republican

DonaldTrump,There is a nasty rumor out there that @SenatorCollins of Maine will not be supporting our great United States Supreme Court Nominee. Well she didn’t support Healthcare or my opening up 5000 square miles of Ocean to Maine so why should this be any different. Not worth the work!,2020,Republican
DonaldTrump,Big T was not a reference to me but rather to Big Tech which should have been properly pointed out in Twitter’s Fake Trending Section!,2020,Republican
DonaldTrump,Steve Scully of @cspan had a very bad week. When his name was announced I said he would not be appropriate because of conflicts. I was right! Then he said he was hacked he wasn’t.

DonaldTrump,I was right again! Steve Scully just admitted he was lying about his Twitter being hacked. The Debate was Rigged! He was suspended from @cspan indefinitely. The Trump Campaign was not treated fairly by the “Commission”. Did I show good instincts in being the first to know?,2020,Republican
